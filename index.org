** Learning outcomes

In this course fundamental visualization concepts as well as concrete
skills to represent large data sets are taught.

Participants will gain an basic understanding of the physiology of
perception and learn to effectively encode information in
figures. Futhermore, they will be introduced to widely used Python
plotting libraries to create figures based on openly available data
sets.

After visiting this course students are able to interprete as well as
design figures and are capable to visualize large data sets.

  Can't get enough of cool xkcd visualization - have a look at [[http://www.vislives.com/2011/10/xkcd-visualizations.html][this collection]].
  
** When and why are visualization useful?

   - Group exercise [15 min] - discuss:
     - When are visualization useful?
     - What are alternatives to visualization?
     - Which disadvantages can visualization have?
   - Live demonstration - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet][Anscombe's quartet]] (see
     =./code/Anscombes_quartet.ipynb=)
   
  
** Attributes and Aestetics

*** Perception

our five senses
- sight (stimulus: light)
- smell (stimulus: chemical substance
- touch (stimulus: presure / temperatur)
- taste (stimulus: chemical substance)
 hearing (stimulus: sound = presure)

=> Data visualisation, Datas sonification

*** Attribues

*** Aestetics

** List of chart types (without claiming completeness)

Group exercise [15 min] - In the group compile a list of chart types
that you know.
       
    - Boxplot
    - Histogram
    - Swarmplot
    - Violin
    - 1D Density
    - Ridgeline
    - Scatterplot
    - Correlogram
    - Bubble
    - Scatter
    - 2D Density
    - Heatmap      
    - Barplot
    - Radar / Spider
    - Wordcloud
    - Parallel
    - Pie

    - Arc Diagram
    - Edge Bundling   

Group exercise [15 min] - discuss:
- Take 3 visualation type and discuss which. Aestetics are used to
  encode the information.

- Plotting lottery - everybody has to generate a plot
  - Alternative names
  - Aestetics used
  - Potential pitfalls
  - Code example
