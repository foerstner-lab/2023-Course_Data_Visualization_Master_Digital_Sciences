** Learning outcomes

In this course fundamental visualization concepts as well as concrete
skills to represent large data sets are taught.

Participants will gain an basic understanding of the physiology of
perception and learn to effectively encode information in
figures. Futhermore, they will be introduced to widely used Python
plotting libraries to create figures based on openly available data
sets.

After the course students are able to interprete as well as design
figures and are capable to visualize large data sets.

* Chart Junk

  #+CAPTION: "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information", Tufte, 1983
  #+begin_quote
  The interior decoration of graphics generates a lot of ink that does
  not tell the viewer anything new. The purpose of decoration
  varies—to make the graphic appear more scientific and precise, to
  enliven the display, to give the designer an opportunity to exercise
  artistic skills. Regardless of its cause, it is all non-data-ink or
  redundant data-ink, and it is often chartjunk.
  #+end_quote


  #+CAPTION: Data Visualization Practitioners’ Perspectives on Chartjunk
  #+begin_quote
  Tufte is credited with coining the term chartjunk in his 1983 book
  The Visual Display of Quantitative Information [40]. He defined it
  as “ink that does not tell the viewer anything new” and “non-data-ink
  or redundant data-ink”. Tufte defined data-ink as “the non-erasable
  core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to
  variation in the numbers represented”, and the data–ink ratio as the
  ratio of the data-ink over the total ink used in a graphic [40].
  #+end_quote

* Animation and Interaction

** Advantages and disadvantages

Advantages
- detailed / additional can be included and displayed if needed useful
- possibility to include another dimension e.g. time
- easier switch between overview and detail view
- viewer can choose level of details  

Disadvantages
- more technological dependency then a simple image
- reduced accessiblity

* Data visualization project

The project should give you the chance to apply the learnt skills and reflect the outcomes. It can be can be conducted individually or in groups of two. The project should include visualizations of a data set of choice and conclusions that can be made of them. You are free in the choice of tools but ideally approaches presented in the lecture are applied.

    briefly
  - Ideally use an Open Source License ([OSI](https://opensource.org/)
    compliant) e.g. [[https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/][MIT License]] ([[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository][further info on GitHub]])
  - can be public or private (in the later case invite user `konrad`)
- *Presentation*
  - In the last session (2022-06-20)  
  - 10 min presentation + 5 min questions/answers
  - Free mode - either slides, walk through the repo, demo or
    combinations
- *Report*
  - Deadline July 4th, 18:00
  - Submission via Illias
  - Volume: 7,000 - 10,000 characters (exluding references)
