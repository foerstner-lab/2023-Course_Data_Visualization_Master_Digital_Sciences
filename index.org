** Learning outcomes

In this course fundamental visualization concepts as well as concrete
skills to represent large data sets are taught.

Participants will gain an basic understanding of the physiology of
perception and learn to effectively encode information in
figures. Futhermore, they will be introduced to widely used Python
plotting libraries to create figures based on openly available data
sets.

After the course students are able to interprete as well as design
figures and are capable to visualize large data sets.

** Attributes and Aestetics

*** Perception

our five senses
- sight (stimulus: light)
- smell (stimulus: chemical substance
- touch (stimulus: presure / temperatur)
- taste (stimulus: chemical substance)
- hearing (stimulus: sound = presure)

=> Data visualisation, Datas sonification

*** Features/Attribues

    Features can be
    - categorical / qualitative
      - Nominal (e.g. cell line, cancer type, eye color, gender)
      - Ordinal (e.g. very bad, bad, good, very good)
    - numerical / quantitative
      - Discrete (e.g. gene length in nucleotides, number cells)
      - Continuous (e.g. cell length, concentration, relative expression) 
    
*** Aesthetics

** The three basic color appearance parameters 

(according to Albert Henry Munsell)

- Hue (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet)
- Lightness (black to white)
- Saturation (aka chroma or intensity; )
    
** Colormaps
   
  - Qualitative/categorical - for mapping categorical feature to colors
  - Sequential - for quantitave, ordinal data
  - Diverging - For numerical data that have a midpoint (e.g. range from -5 to 5)
  - (Cyclic)

* Chart Junk

  #+CAPTION: "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information", Tufte, 1983
  #+begin_quote
  The interior decoration of graphics generates a lot of ink that does
  not tell the viewer anything new. The purpose of decoration
  varies—to make the graphic appear more scientific and precise, to
  enliven the display, to give the designer an opportunity to exercise
  artistic skills. Regardless of its cause, it is all non-data-ink or
  redundant data-ink, and it is often chartjunk.
  #+end_quote


  #+CAPTION: Data Visualization Practitioners’ Perspectives on Chartjunk
  #+begin_quote
  Tufte is credited with coining the term chartjunk in his 1983 book
  The Visual Display of Quantitative Information [40]. He defined it
  as “ink that does not tell the viewer anything new” and “non-data-ink
  or redundant data-ink”. Tufte defined data-ink as “the non-erasable
  core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to
  variation in the numbers represented”, and the data–ink ratio as the
  ratio of the data-ink over the total ink used in a graphic [40].

* Animation and Interaction

** Advantages and disadvantages

Advantages
- 

Disadvantages
- more technological dependency then a simple image
