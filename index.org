** Learning outcomes

In this course fundamental visualization concepts as well as concrete
skills to represent large data sets are taught.

Participants will gain an basic understanding of the physiology of
perception and learn to effectively encode information in
figures. Futhermore, they will be introduced to widely used Python
plotting libraries to create figures based on openly available data
sets.

After the course students are able to interprete as well as design
figures and are capable to visualize large data sets.

** Schedule

- 2022-04-04
   
  - General Introdution
  - Basics of Visualization
  - Tasks until next week:
    - Read chapter 2 "[[https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/aesthetic-mapping.html][Visualizing data: Mapping data onto aesthetics]]" of "Fundamentals of Data Visualization"
    - Install [[https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution][Anaconda]] ([[https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-python-intro/setup.html][Further instructions]])
    - Prepare to present you visualization type
      - Alternative names
      - Aesthetics used
      - Potential pitfalls
   
- 2022-04-11:
  - Housekeeping
  - Question and repetition
  - Short introduction of one visualization type by the participants (~ 60 min)
  - Introduction to [[https://seaborn.pydata.org/][seaborn]] ([[./code/Introduction_into_seaborn.ipynb][Jupyter Notebook]]) using the [[https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/penguins.csv][penguin data set]] (~ 45 min)
  - Group exercise (pairs) (20 min) - visualizeing other data sets with seaborn using
    [[https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/penguins.csv][other data set]] in the seaborn collection.
    - planets.csv (TODO: description of columns)
    - tips.csv (TODO: description of columns)
    - titanic.csv (TODO: description of columns)
    - iris.csv (TODO: description of columns)

  - Tasks until next week:
    - Please prepare a Jupyter Notebook with examples of the
      visualisation type that you discussed today. Ideally show
      different examples for the aestetics used. Please don't only
      copy and paste but generate own examples. Commit to the
      dedicated git repo.
    - Make yourself familiar with the term "chart junk" and find a
      example in current media (blog, news paper, magazin).

* Introduction into Data Visualizations

  Can't get enough of cool xkcd visualization - have a look at [[http://www.vislives.com/2011/10/xkcd-visualizations.html][this collection]].
  
** When and why are visualization useful?

   - Group exercise [15 min] - discuss:
     - When are visualization useful?
     - What are alternatives to visualization?
     - Which disadvantages can visualization have?
   - Live demonstration - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet][Anscombe's quartet]] (see
     =./code/Anscombes_quartet.ipynb=)
   
  
** Attributes and Aestetics

*** Perception

our five senses
- sight (stimulus: light)
- smell (stimulus: chemical substance
- touch (stimulus: presure / temperatur)
- taste (stimulus: chemical substance)
- hearing (stimulus: sound = presure)

=> Data visualisation, Datas sonification

*** Encoding / Decoding

    #+CAPTION: Encoding / Decoding
    #+NAME: fig:Encoding
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 500
    [[./images/Data_encode_visualisation_decode.png]]

*** Features/Attribues

    Features can be
    - categorical / qualitative
      - Nominal (e.g. cell line, cancer type, eye color, gender)
      - Ordinal (e.g. very bad, bad, good, very good)
    - numerical / quantitative
      - Discrete (e.g. gene length in nucleotides, number cells)
      - Continuous (e.g. cell length, concentration, relative expression) 
    
*** Aesthetics
    
    Aesthetics - anciet greek αἴσθησις;
